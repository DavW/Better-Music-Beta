### Overview

Better Music Beta is a simple Google Chrome extension to notify you of song changes in the Music Beta web application. It operates much like an iTunes growl notification, showing album art, song title and artist.

### FAQ

**Why doesn't it work after I install?**

You need to refresh the Google Music Beta page in order for the script to start watching for song changes.

**Why doesn't it show album art for my song? The CD has it!**

Your album art is not fully applied to every song on the album. The music toaster only uses the information you see at the bottom of the Music Beta window (so if there is not an image to go with the song, it will not look for the CD image elsewhere).
